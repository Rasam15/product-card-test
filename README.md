## ðŸ§  Layout approach
I created a reusable `ProductCard` component with modern layout using Flexbox and custom CSS. The structure is scalable and fits easily into any product listing page.

## ðŸ“± Responsiveness
The card automatically adjusts to smaller screen sizes using media queries. Buttons and dropdowns are full-width on mobile to ensure touch usability.
